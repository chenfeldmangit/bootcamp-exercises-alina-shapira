                        Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he
                        reached
                        the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought
                        to
                        have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in
                        Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. "Teh monks were not to blame, in any
                        case,"
                        he reflceted, on the steps. "And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I
                        understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall
                        in
                        with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that
                        Aesop,
                        thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have."

                        He determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the
                        wood-cuting
                        and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much
                        less
                        valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.
